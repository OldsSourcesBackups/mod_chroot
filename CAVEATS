DNS lookups

   libresolv uses /etc/resolv.conf to find your DNS server. If this file
   doesn't exist, libresolv uses 127.0.0.1:53 as the DNS server. You can run
   a small caching server listening on 127.0.0.1 (which may be a good idea
   anyway), or use your operating system's firewall to transparently redirect
   queries to 127.0.0.1:53 to your real DNS server. Note that this is only
   necessary if you do DNS lookups - probably this can be avoided?

Databases

   If your mySQL/PostgreSQL accepts connections on a Unix socket which is
   outside of your chroot jail, reconfigure it to listen on a loopback
   address (127.0.0.1).

PHP mail() function

   Under Unix, PHP requires a sendmail binary to send mail. Putting this file
   inside your jail may not be sufficient: you would probably need to move
   your mail queue as well. You have three options here:

     * install a SMTP-only sendmail clone like sSMTP or nbsmtp. You can then
       put a single binary inside your jail, and deliver mail via a
       smarthost.
     * don't use mail(). Use a class/function that knows how to send directly
       via SMTP (like Pear's Mail)
     * convince PHP developers to make SMTP support a configurable option
       under Unix

Others?

   Did you have other problems with Apache+mod_chroot? Please send your
   experiences to the mailing list, I'll publish them here.

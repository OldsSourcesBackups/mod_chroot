Applying EAPI patches

   Apache modules are initialized twice. mod_chroot needs to perform chroot()
   during the second time. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell if we
   are initialized for the first or second time. mod_chroot checks if the
   parent PID is 1 (init), but this sometimes fails. EAPI (part of mod_ssl)
   solves this problem - it allows modules to store persistent information.

   EAPI is a patch for Apache. You don't need to install mod_ssl to apply
   this patch. That's how:

    1. Download mod_ssl for your Apache version from www.modssl.org
    2. Unpack the tarball and apply the patch:

 tar -xzf mod_ssl-x.y.z-a.b.c.tar.gz
 cd mod_ssl-x.y.z-a.b.c
 ./configure --with-apache=/patch/to/apache --with-eapi-only

   Congratulations! You now have EAPI-enabled Apache!
